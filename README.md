# Python Projects
Projects I have done in Python3 regarding various topics including GUI implementation, machine learning, and webscraping. Projects I have worked on include:

spaceshooter - GUI of a 2D shooter game implemented with Pythonâ€™s pygame module.

sudoku - A python script that can solve a sudoku board using backtracking and recursion. An interactive version in the form of a pygame GUI is also included.

mlbasics - Simple implementations of machine learing algorithms using tensorflow and Python3's sklearn module.

covid_stats.py - A bot implemented through Python's selenium module that webscrapes coronavirus statisitcs from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ to provide the user statistics of a country of their choice or globally.

Note: for covid_stats.py which uses selenium webdriver, installing chromedriver will be required in order to run the bot.
