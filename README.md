# Python Projects
Projects I have done in Python3 regarding various topics including GUI implementation, machine learning, and web scraping. Projects I have worked on include:

spaceshooter - a 2D shooter game made with pygame as the GUI.

sudoku - a python script that can solve a sudoku board using backtracking and recursion. An interactive version in the form of a pygame GUI is also included.
