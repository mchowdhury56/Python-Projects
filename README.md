# Python Projects
Projects I have done in Python3 regarding various topics including GUI implementation, machine learning, and web scraping. Projects I have worked on include:

spaceshooter - A 2D shooter game made with pygame to implement the GUI.

sudoku - A python script that can solve a sudoku board using backtracking and recursion. An interactive version in the form of a pygame GUI is also included.

mlbasics - Simple implementations of machine learing algorithms using tensorflow and Python3's sklearn module.
